# ACL support repository
This is a simple repository to host files for the following google colab notebook: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ya4Dhih8JU-do9t4gcxkU4pgb9Gm8dmo/view?usp=sharing (though you can also just clone the repository and run the notebook in it on your own computer :) )

The notebook is a demonstration of the results of our paper, "On the Practical Computational Power of Finite Precision RNNs for Language Recognition". It holds 4 pretrained networks: the languages $a^nb^n$ and $a^nb^nc^n$, on LSTM and GRU networks. You can also train your own networks.
